<p>When you first install PostgreSQL on your computer, you are given a default user (<code>postgres</code>) and you are required to supply a password. Don’t lose this! This post is for users who <em>know</em> their password, and would like to re-set it to a different password.</p>
<p><em>Why</em> would you want to do this? Well, maybe for security reasons perhaps. But my more mundane reason is that I wanted to demonstrate how to get started with PostgreSQL, but not with my own super secret password! I needed to change it to something more… impersonal. So here is how I did it on <em>Windows 10 Enterprise</em> with <em>PostgreSQL 10</em>.</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>Open <code>pgAdmin</code> by searching for it in the Windows search box.

<li><p>Click on <code>Servers</code> and you will be prompted to enter your existing password.

<li><p>Expand the <code>Servers</code> menu to find the default user of <code>postgres</code>. Right-click on <code>postgres</code> and then click on <code>Properties</code>.

<li><p>Under the <code>Definition</code> tab, enter your new password. Don’t forget to <code>Save</code> at the bottom of this window.

<li><p>Open <code>Services</code> by searching for it in the Windows search box.

<li><p>Re-start PostgreSQL with a right-click.

</ol>
<p>Done!</p>
