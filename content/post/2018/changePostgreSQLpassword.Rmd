When you first install PostgreSQL on your computer, you are given a default user (`postgres`) and you are required to supply a password.  Don't lose this!  This post is for users who *know* their password, and would like to re-set it to a different password.  

*Why* would you want to do this?  Well, maybe for security reasons perhaps.  But my more mundane reason is that I wanted to demonstrate how to get started with PostgreSQL, but not with my own super secret password!  I needed to change it to something more... impersonal.  So here is how I did it on _Windows 10 Enterprise_ with _PostgreSQL 10_.

1.  Open `pgAdmin` by searching for it in the Windows search box.

2.  Click on `Servers` and you will be prompted to enter your existing password.

3.  Expand the `Servers` menu to find the default user of `postgres`.  Right-click on `postgres` and then click on `Properties`.

4.  Under the `Definition` tab, enter your new password. Don't forget to `Save` at the bottom of this window.

5.  Open `Services` by searching for it in the Windows search box.

6.  Re-start PostgreSQL with a right-click.

Done!
