## Professional / fun facts

{{< figure src="/images/cirprofile.png" height="100" >}}

Iâ€™m an enthusiastic data scientist, professional educator, and statistical consultant with over ten years of collaborating on data analysis with diverse partners in tech, public health, and clinical research.  My previous work experiences include propelling research on parasitic diseases at the CDC, expanding the Institute for Quantitative Theory and Methods at Emory University, and instructing advanced programming and modeling courses at California Polytechnic State University, San Luis Obispo.    

## Personal

{{< figure src="/images/family.jpg" height="200">}}

I now have two daughters, one of which is my alarm clock and the other is my midnight collaborator.  My partner is incredibly supportive and inspirational, and [he](http://avpileggi.com/) schools me daily on data and R programming.  I've won many coveted recreational soccer league _Champion_ t-shirts, and more recently I started biking to work (with the kids!).  And on those rare occasions when both children are asleep and we aren't working or talking about data, you'll find us relaxing with beer and board games.
