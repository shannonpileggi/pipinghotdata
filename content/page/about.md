I now have two daughters, one of which is my alarm clock and the other is my midnight collaborator.  My partner is incredibly supportive and inspirational, and [he](http://avpileggi.com/) schools me daily on data and R programming.  I've won many coveted recreational soccer league _Champion_ t-shirts, and more recently I started biking to work (with the kids!).  And on those rare occasions when both children are asleep and we aren't working or talking about data, you'll find us relaxing with beer and board games.
